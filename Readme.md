# Hangman feature with ASCII-Art part

## Objectives

You must follow the same [principle](https://github.com/Lyon-Ynov-Campus/YTrack/tree/master/subjects/hangman/hangman-classic) as the first subject.
Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII. Time to write big.
What we mean by a graphic representation using ASCII, is to write the string received using ASCII characters, as you can see in the example below:

    ██   ██ ███████ ██      ██       ██████      ██ 
    ██   ██ ██      ██      ██      ██    ██     ██ 
    ███████ █████   ██      ██      ██    ██     ██ 
    ██   ██ ██      ██      ██      ██    ██        
    ██   ██ ███████ ███████ ███████  ██████      ██ 
                                                
## Instructions
